#John's Music Library

##This webpage is live at:  52.37.48.12/JML

John's Music Library was created as a project for my Web Programming course at the U of S. It is a simple Website that is used to showcase your favourite musicians by supplying thier name, a color, a link to a youtube video, and optionally other social medai links. Right now this site allows anyone to add artists to the main "Browse Artists" page, but in the future, I would like each user to have theor own page ans well as a main feed.

It uses a RESTful API to update and display the list of artists currently in the database. AngualrJS is used in the front end to make HTTP requests consume the API. Facebook Login is used to allow users to alter the list of artists (although this is far from secure, it is not quite implemented properly). The Google Maps API is used to show the user's location on the home page.
